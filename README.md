# ColorBot

# BUILD SNAPSHOT 0.1.14
Attempting a simplified "Color" Bot.
It's not simple.

# UPDATE LOG

* [Kinda] Fixed file writing. Proper lines write, but not in the correct area.

# Commands:
  *[IMPLIMENTED]*
  
  !colors ........................ Lists all availible colors on the server, edited in colors.json
  
  !color (COLORNAME) ............. Makes your role color the color of the color you chose
  
  !color add (COLORNAME) (HEX) ... Will add a role color to colors.json and the server specifying the name and hex color
  
  *[UNIMPLIMENTED]*
  
  !color remove (COLORNAME) ...... Will remove the specified role color from colors.json and the server
  
  !color edit (COLORNAME) ........ Edit a color's name
  
  !color edit (COLORNAME) (HEX) .. Edit a color's hex code
  
  !colors clear .................. ADMIN COMMAND, Clear all colors from the sever
  
  !colors default ................ ADMIN COMMAND, Clear all non-default colors from the server
  

Each server member can only have one color active at a time.
Each color is made with the same permissions (default), so placement does not matter.

I plan on re-organizing everything at some point; this version is only a test build / proof of concept.

This code is fully Open-Source, and you may request ideas and changes.
